# üß† CNN Model Comparison for Image Classification

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on training, evaluating, and comparing multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for medical image classification. The primary objective is to identify the most efficient model for classifying **bone marrow cell images** accurately and efficiently.

## üß™ Objective
To determine the best CNN model for bone marrow image classification based on:
- Accuracy & F1-Score
- Training Time
- Model Complexity (parameters & size)

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
- **Bone Marrow Cell Images Dataset**: A labeled medical dataset containing microscopic images of bone marrow cells across multiple classes.
- Dataset includes variations in staining, magnification, and cell morphology, making it ideal for deep learning-based evaluation.
- Format: RGB images, resized to 128√ó128 during preprocessing.
